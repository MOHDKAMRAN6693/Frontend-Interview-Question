**Answer:**
Call stack tracks function calls, event loop manages asynchronous operations and callback execution.

### 67. What are JavaScript memory leaks and how do you prevent them?
**Answer:**
Memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed but still referenced. Prevent by proper cleanup and weak references.
