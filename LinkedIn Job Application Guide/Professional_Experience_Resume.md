Translate complex UI/UX designs from Figma or Adobe XD into responsive, pixel-perfect layouts.

Maintain a consistent design system using Angular Material, Tailwind, or custom component libraries.

Ensure accessibility (WCAG) and cross-browser/device compatibility.

4. Performance Optimization

Improve rendering performance using lazy loading, route-level code splitting, and ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush.

Optimize initial load time and minimize bundle sizes through AOT compilation and tree-shaking.

Use Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools, and Angular profiler for identifying performance bottlenecks.

5. Quality Assurance & Testing

Enforce unit testing and integration testing using Jasmine, Karma, Jest, or Cypress.

Conduct code reviews to maintain consistent quality and adherence to coding standards.

Estimate effort, plan deliverables, and ensure timely completion of sprints.

Communicate effectively with product owners and stakeholders about technical feasibility and timelines.

8. DevOps & Deployment

Collaborate with DevOps teams to automate CI/CD pipelines for Angular applications.

Manage builds, environment configurations, and deployment to staging/production environments (AWS, Azure, Vercel, etc.).

Handle application monitoring, logging, and version control using Git, Bitbucket, or GitLab.

9. Documentation & Maintenance

Create and maintain technical documentation including architecture diagrams, code flow, and API references.

Continuously refactor legacy code to improve maintainability and performance.
