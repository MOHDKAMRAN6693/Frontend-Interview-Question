Tell Me About Yourself – Spoken Version:

Hi, I’m Mohd Kamran, a Frontend Software Engineer with around 3.8 years of experience in building scalable and user-focused web applications, primarily using Angular.

I started my career at Walking Tree Technologies, where I worked on enterprise-grade Angular projects for clients in domains like oilfield operations and education, focusing on performance optimization, reusable UI components, and clean architecture.

Currently, I’m working at InnovationM as a Software Engineer, where I’m involved in designing and implementing modular frontend architectures, integrating RESTful APIs, and improving application performance and maintainability.

I’ve worked with technologies like Angular (v12 to v18), TypeScript, RxJS, NgRx, and Angular Material, and I enjoy creating intuitive, responsive interfaces that deliver great user experiences.

I’m passionate about writing maintainable, efficient code and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products. Right now, I’m looking to take on new challenges where I can contribute to impactful projects and continue growing as a frontend engineer.
